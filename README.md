Code for reconstructing the object domain contrast function using Born Approximation in inverse scattering problem 

File ProblemStatement.pdf describes the problem statement in detail. 
This assignment was for the course WaveField Imaging (EE4595) at TU Delft. 

Briefly the problem statement demands defining an object domain, source domain and a reciever domain. Creating a 
contrast function satisfying the Born Approximation, finding the system matrix and then reconstrution of the the contrast function
assuming that the scattered field at the reciver is given.
